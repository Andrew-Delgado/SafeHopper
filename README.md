## Code Snippents
### Get an API key and enable the necessary APIs
To get an API key:

  - Visit the Google Cloud Platform Console.
- Click the project drop-down and select or create the project for which you want to add an API key.
- Click the menu button  and select APIs & Services > Credentials.
- On the Credentials page, click Create credentials > API key. 
- The API key created dialog displays your newly created API key.
Click Close. 
- The new API key is listed on the Credentials page under API keys. (Remember to restrict the API key before using it in production.)

Add the API key to your app:

Follow the steps below to include the API key in your application's manifest, contained in the file ```AndroidManifest.xml```.

In ``` AndroidManifest.xml```, add the following element as a child of the <application> element, by inserting it just before the closing </application> tag:
``` java
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
        android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/>
```

In the value attribute, replace YOUR_API_KEY with your API key (the encrypted string). This element sets the key com.google.android.geo.API_KEY to the value of your API key.
Save AndroidManifest.xml and re-build your application.



### Retrieving User Location
Enable the my location layer if the permission has been granted.
This method enables the location layer if the permission has been granted. 

```Java
private void enableMyLocation() {
        if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)
                != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
            PermissionUtils.requestPermission(this, LOCATION_PERMISSION_REQUEST_CODE,
                    Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, true);
        }
        else if(mMap != null){
            mMap.setMyLocationEnabled(true);
        }
    }
```
If permission to user location has been granted , user location is retrieved and a blue circle is displayed on the google map. This method will retrieve the current location and log the lat/lng.
```Java
 private void getCurrentLocation(){
        fusedLocationClient = LocationServices.getFusedLocationProviderClient(this);
        fusedLocationClient.getLastLocation()
                .addOnSuccessListener(this, new OnSuccessListener<Location>() {
                    @Override
                    public void onSuccess(Location location) {
                        // Got last known location. In some rare situations this can be null.
                        Log.d("CURRENT-LOCATION", location.toString());
                    }
                });
    }
```
